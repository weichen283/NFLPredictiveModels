In this report we examine a few, looking at what insights we can gather from each. We have utilized several modern AI algorithms and techniques to generate models and figures capable of providing us insights into the characteristics of our sample population. We used these models in the context of analyzing over 45 years of player data to show off the usefulness of these algorithms in the real-world data analysis process.
